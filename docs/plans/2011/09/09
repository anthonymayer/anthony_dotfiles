ActionMapper -> RequestMapper
    @expose maps to four rules:
        get: And(POST(), Path())
        post: And(GET(), Path())
        action: And(POST(), Action())
        action+get: And(GET(), Action())

    This could be represented as one fairly strange-looking rule:
        Or(Path('^save/?$'), Action('save')), self.save

    This works, and competely covers compatiblity issues, but nobody likes it.

    * I can run a MRjob against the ranger logs to see which rule is actually needed.
    * For the jobs that are not found in ranger (old, infrequently-used flows), 
        I'm adding a ActionMapperShim which tests each of the above four rules in series and logs which one is used.
    * do a quick analysis of templates, to classify into trivial / hard

    New tickets to be filed:
        Getting rid of cmds._request_mapper.Action (jon and minh agree this is bad, even dangerous, style)
        Analysing data collected by ActionMapperShim and refactoring accordingly
